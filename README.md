# Codes in C/C++ 

I started my programming studies in 2012 with C and it was the first language learned.

Here in this repository, it has this trajectory, the codes here are usually in the imperative method and in general, most do not have good programming practices.

Most of the codes are from competitive programming exercises or from technical or college course exercises.

I thought about refactoring all of them to make them practical, to make better use of variables, but here's my story in programming and it's good to see our evolution over time.

Although I lost most of the codes from the years 2014-2018, the ones I didn't are here.

## Topics
         
        - C IN URI 2017 > Codes I used to do URI competitive programming exercises in 2017, all pretty simple.
        - CODEFORCE > Codes I made in 2012, I barely used the Codeforces platform, but who knows, maybe one day I will use it?
        - DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING > A few diverse dynamic programming exercises.
        - FPU 2016 > Exercises of a programming discipline that were delivered to the professor of FPU (Polytechnic College of Uberlândia)
        - GRAFS > Some exercises using graphs, some using competitive programming and other examples of use.
        - INICIALIZING STUDIES > Exercises I did when I went back to studying programming to remember uses of classes, structures, functions and the like.
        - STUDIES FOR INTERVIEW > Some codes to answer questions from websites preparing for job interviews
        - TOOLS > This is the gold around here. These are the tools that exemplify how to use some functions in C++.
        - UFU 2018 > Solved exercises of two programming disciplines in C/C++ at the Federal University of Uberlândia(UFU)
        - URI C++ > Well, here we find several exercises from easy to difficult in C++ solving competitive programming exercises from the URI site.
        
Note: in 2021 the URI site changed its name to Beecrowd.

See you later!
